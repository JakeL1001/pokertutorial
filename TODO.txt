--TODO list!--
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
ADD LOG FILE.

fix all remaining TODOs (ctrl+shift+f, then search TODO)

Edit the readme to abide by this:
    In addition to the web application, you should create a private GitHub project that includes a readme describing:
        the purpose of the web application, explaining both the context and the assessment mechanism used.
        the architecture of the web application.
        describe how to launch the web application.
        describe some unit tests for the web application, and how to run them.
        Include commit logs, showing contributions and review from both contributing students

Must reference every external thing we used (somehow, idk how exactly)

Prepare a zip folder including all these:
    a full readme.md, describing the design and development of the application, and giving instructions on how to launch from local host.
    the git log, showing commits from both partners
    all source code, with comments and attributions for any external libraries.
    a requirements.txt file, listing all packages used. To build the requirements.txt file for your virtual environment, use the command: pip freeze > requirements.txt while your virtual environment is active.

could probably add even more users and quiz results for those users for the stats page

additional extras (if there's time):

add score of previous tests on the card of the lessons page

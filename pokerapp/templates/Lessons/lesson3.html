       Poker is a turn based game. There are stages of play that come in an order. That is:
       the pre-flop, flop, post-flop, turn, post turn, the river then the final round of betting.
       In all these stages of play there is either action of betting, or cards being laid onto the table.
       Here is what post-flop looks like for example:

        Players make actions during these betting phases. Players can fold, bet, raise or check.
        A fold means the player forfeits the round, places their cards out of their hand and sits out.
        A bet means the player is placing a bet into the community pot of chips.
        A raise means the player is increasing the minimum bet size with their own bet.
        A check is when the player does not bet further as they have already put in an amount that satisfies the current bet.
    </p>

        Cards come down onto the table in three stages; the flop, the turn and the river. 
        On the flop, three cards come down, face up after one has been discarded from the deck.
        On the turn, a fourth card is placed on the table after one has been discarded. 
        The last card called the river is placed on the table on the penultimate stage of play.
